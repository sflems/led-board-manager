If you are interested in contributing. Simply create a new issue regarding your fix or feature and link it in a PR to the `dev` branch.

When adding a new complex feature, please include some tests for the new code.

The current Django test suit must also pass with any PRs, and can be run using the command:

```env/bin/python3 manage.py test```
...from the project directory.


Help is always appreciated. Cheers!
